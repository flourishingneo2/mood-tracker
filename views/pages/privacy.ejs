      <h2>What information do we collect and how is it used?</h2>
      <p>We collect and store the following data to provide access to the service and improve user experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Your username</b>: Used for basic access and identification purposes</li>
        <li><b>Hashed password</b> (using bcrypt): To securely authorize you into your account </li>
        <li><b>Profile settings and privacy settings</b>: To customize data collection and personalize the service</li>
        <li><b>Mood updates</b>: Stored to provide analytics and insights into your mood, which you can view on your profile. The history is analyzed locally, but the data is stored on our side</li>
        <li>Some data may be accessible through our API by others if they know your username and your profile is not private. Only mood data and history is shared through the API.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The data is stored indefinitely by default, but you can limit the amount of days the mood history is stored up to in the profile settings (or disable the history entirely, storing only the current mood).</p>

      <h2>Managing your data</h2>
      <p>
        You can delete your account in the profile settings at any time and we will immediately delete all your data.
        There's also an option in the profile settings to clear all mood history.
        Additionally, you can download a JSON file containing all the data we store about you in your profile settings.
      </p>

    <section id="third_party">
      <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
      <p>While some of your data such as current mood and the history may be accessed using our API, we will never sell or share your data to anyone else.</p>
